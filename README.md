# DevCoffee

This repository documents the integrative project that combines coffee spice production with process automation. The main objective is to showcase the intuitive functionality of the website and how it provides credibility to new participants in the coffee production industry. The project is implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Objectives

The DevCoffee project aims to achieve the following objectives:

- **Intuitive Platform**: Present an easy-to-use online platform for accessing detailed information about coffee products and production processes.
- **Building Trust**: Establish trust and credibility among new participants in the coffee industry.

## Automation Process

Automation is applied at various stages of the coffee spice production process:

- **Planting**: Selected seeds are planted in special nurseries. The soil is prepared to provide ideal nutrients. There are two main species in Brazil: Arabica (mild climates) and Robusta (medium temperatures).
- **Harvesting**: The ripe fruits are harvested between May and August. Harvesting can be done manually, by stripping (using plastics), or by machines.
- **Drying**: The beans are cleaned, pulped, and dried in patios or machines until they reach the correct moisture level.
- **Grading**: Specialists evaluate the beans for defects and quality, following international standards.
- **Roasting**: Heating above 140Â°C transforms the beans, generating unique aromas and flavors.
- **Packaging**: The coffee is packaged to preserve its characteristics until preparation.

## Platform Features

The DevCoffee online platform offers the following features:

- **Detailed Information**: Access detailed information about the produced coffee spices.
- **Visual Demonstrations**: Visual demonstration of the automated processes through screenshots and explanatory videos.
